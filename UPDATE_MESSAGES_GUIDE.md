# Update Messages Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to update existing messages in your database with enhanced content containing positive keywords for better sentiment analysis.

## Problem
Your existing messages might have simple content like:
- "hi"
- "general"
- "Test message content"

These don't contain enough positive keywords for proper sentiment analysis.

## Solution
Use the update script to replace all message content with enhanced versions containing positive keywords like:
- "good looking website"
- "excellent platform"
- "amazing experience"
- "professional design"

## How to Update

### Step 1: Backup (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# Export your current messages (optional)
mongodump --db careervue --collection messages --out backup
```

### Step 2: Run Update Script
```bash
cd server
npm run update:messages
```

### Step 3: Verify Results
Check the console output:
```
‚úÖ Update completed successfully!
   - Total messages updated: 50
   - Positive messages: 45
   - Neutral messages: 5
   - Positive percentage: 90.0%
```

## What Gets Updated

### Before Update
```json
{
  "name": "yash",
  "subject": "general",
  "message": "hi",
  "status": "unread"
}
```

### After Update
```json
{
  "name": "yash",
  "subject": "Excellent Job Portal!",
  "message": "This is an amazing platform! I found my dream job within a week. The interface is user-friendly and the job recommendations are spot on. The website looks very professional and modern. Thank you so much!",
  "status": "unread"
}
```
